In recent years, advancements in agriculture have been driven by the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), opening new pathways to enhance productivity, reduce operational costs, and promote sustainable farming practices. Cloud technology has enabled the development of this agriculture bot platform and its interactive questionnaire, facilitating real-time fertilization management and the detection of soil-borne diseases for improved agricultural outcomes. The bot offers solutions for managing soil health and crop diseases by answering farmers' questions through a user-friendly interface.

This project's goal is to build an interface that addresses farmers' challenges, offering solutions and designing a platform that is accessible and beneficial for illiterate farmers, providing support in multiple languages to ensure inclusivity and usability.
The project utilizes a tech stack which are listed below: -
1) HTML
2) CSS
3) JavaScript
4) Bootstrap
5) Java
6) Azure Cloud services
